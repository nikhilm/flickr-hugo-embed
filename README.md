flickr-hugo-embed
=================

A node.js tool that generates shortcodes for all the photos in a Flickr Album
to allow easily embedding Flickr images into a static site created using
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io)

An example generated code:

    {{% flickr "Title"
               "Caption"
               "link to photo page"
               "link to source image" %}}

The flickr shortcode is provided in this repository and can be copied to
`layouts/shortcodes/flickr.html` in your site's directory.

Only works on public images since it does not perform user authentication.

Setup
-----

Clone this repository, then:

    npm install .

You will have to [get a API key][getkey] from Flickr.

[getkey]: https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/

Create a file `config.ini` in the current directory:

    api_key = "put the new API key here"
    user_id = "put your user ID here"
    size = "Medium 640"

The user id can be obtained by visiting [this page][getphotos] while you are
logged in. It will show the ID in "Useful Values"

[getphotos]: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photosets.getPhotos

Possible values for the `size` attribute are found [here][sizes]. If a photo
does not have the size you select, it will be ignored

[sizes]: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html

The default shortcode always sets the image width and height as 640x480
corresponding to the "Medium 640" size.

Run
---

    node bin.js

prints out all albums (photosets) so you can find the ID of the album
(photoset).

    node bin.js photosetid

generates flickr shortcode for each photo in the photoset.

You can put each code wherever you want to include the image in your site.

The first run can take a little time as the Flickr API is introspected and
cached.

Copy over `flickr.html` to `layouts/shortcodes/` in your Hugo installation and you
are ready to go!

The default shortcode is based on the code generated by the `figure` shortcode
in the theme [twentyfourteen](https://github.com/jaden/twentyfourteen). You can
edit it as you like, but remember to access the write positional parameters.
